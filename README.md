# Movies To Watch
## Phase 3: Sign-in

In this project, we will build a database of movies, and eventually allow users to keep track of which movies they want to watch. A movie wishlist, essentially.

For this phase, we'll complete the final functional piece of the app - letting users keep track of which movies they want to watch.

### Part 1

Let users sign in using Devise. Use [this guide][1] as reference.

### Part 2

Edit the Devise forms to use Bootstrap. Make sure you generate the Devise views so you can edit them. Use the above guide as a reference. 

### Part 3

Make the "add to watch list" and "remove to watch list" buttons functional. It's up to you to decide the strategy for tackling this problem. It may help to break down the problem into discrete steps, then tackle each step one-at-a-time.

### Part 3

Create a User show page to display the signed in user's movie watchlist. The page page should be distinct from the user edit page you get with Devise.

Hint: You might need to create a new controller from scratch
